Your smile is contagious.
I bet you make babies smile.
You have the best laugh.
You light up the room.
You have a great sense of humor.
If cartoon bluebirds were real, a couple of 'em would be sitting on your shoulders singing right now.
You're like sunshine on a rainy day.
You bring out the best in other people.
I bet you sweat glitter.
Colors seem brighter when you're around.
You're more fun than a ball pit filled with candy.
Jokes are funnier when you tell them.
You always know how to find that silver lining.
You're a candle in the darkness.
Being around you is like a happy little vacation.
You're more fun than bubble wrap.
You're like a breath of fresh air.
You're someone's reason to smile.
How do you keep being so funny and making everyone laugh?
